This website is my first solo attempt at development. There are advantages and disadvantages in the code, but over time and with experience, I will overcome the disadvantages.

I was requested to develop a promo website for local photographer Helen Berry. I started coding in the summer of 2024 using vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS. Due to switching PCs, some of the files became corrupted, and I had to redo some parts of the code and commit it to Git later when I had free time.

-All you need to do is download the repository
